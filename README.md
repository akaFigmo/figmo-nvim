# figmo-nvim
This Neovim configuration uses the Lazy package manager and is based off of Kickstart.

I'm going to keep the documentation pretty minimal, this repo mostly exists so I can keep
my config up to date between all the devices.

## Usage
Clone the repo to your Neovim configuration path or use it as a reference, whatever.

If you clone the repo and want to use it straight up, rename it to `nvim` in your config folder.

## Plugins
- zk: note taking assistant (uses telescope)
- telescope: fuzzy finder
- mason: LSP
- tresitter: plugin for treesitter parser (on master branch)
- colorscheme: kanagawa
